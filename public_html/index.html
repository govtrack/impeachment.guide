      <div class="col-sm-12">
      	<p><span class="header">Ambassador targeted by Ukraine</span>  In 2018, former Ukrainian officials, President Trump&rsquo;s associates, and other individuals worked together to mount a case to replace U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Lev Parnas, an American citizen and businessman born in Ukraine, and an associate of his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-sessions-lev-parnas-igor-fruman-contributions-donated">made significant illegal campaign contributions</a> in <strong>June 2018</strong> to former Rep. Pete Sessions and related political entities as a part of a plan to influence the United States government to replace Yovanovitch, according to charges filed by the Justice Department. The plan was reportedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/lutsenko-unnamed-ukrainian-who-led-plot-oust-yovanovitch-says-official-n1065246">at the request of Ukraine&rsquo;s former chief prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko</a>. Later that year, Parnas <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-giuliani-excl/exclusive-trump-lawyer-giuliani-was-paid-500000-to-consult-on-indicted-associates-firm-idUSKBN1WU07Z">hired Rudy Giuliani</a>, who was also working as President Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer, and Giuliani met with Lutsenko about the plan, according to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. On <strong>Jan. 9, 2019</strong> Giuliani asked the State Department to issue Viktor Shokin, Lutsenko&rsquo;s predecessor as Ukraine&rsquo;s chief prosecutor, a visa to travel to the United States so that he could provide information about corruption in the United States, according to Kent, possibly referring to the same plan to oust Yovanovitch.</p>
      	<p class="notes">Parnas was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/lev-parnas-and-igor-fruman-charged-conspiring-violate-straw-and-foreign-donor-bans">charged with conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations in federal elections</a> on Oct. 10, 2019. George Kent, a deputy assistant Secretary of State, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D009.pdf">testified</a> on Oct. 15, 2019 that Lutsenko had planned a May 2018 meeting with Giuliani, for an unknown purpose, but that the meeting never ocurred, and that they later met in early 2019, and that Giuliani asked the State Department to issue a visa to Shokin.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Political research</span>  In <strong>December 2018</strong>, Rep. Devin Nunes, then the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/nunes-vienna-trip-ukrainian-prosecutor-biden/index.html">met with Shokin, the second former Ukrainian chief prosecutor</a>, to pursue information related to former Vice President Joe Biden, the President&rsquo;s chief 2020 election rival at the time, and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to Parnas, the indicted businessman. On <strong>April 10, 2019</strong>, Rep. Nunes spoke with Rudy Giuliani by phone likely about this topic. And by <strong>May 2019</strong>, Giuliani was working on behalf of the President &mdash; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/politics/giuliani-trump-financial-disclosure.html">but for free</a> &mdash; and in collaboration with Parnas &mdash; who had in the previous year paid him $500,000 &mdash; to persuade <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-prosecutor-biden-burisma-back-off-state-department-files">the State Department</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/giuliani-ukraine-trump.html">Ukrainian officials</a> to investigate actions by Biden and his son. Trump, Nunes, and their associates accuse Biden of using his position as vice president, around 2016, to help a Ukrainian energy company which made payments to his son by ousting Shokin, Ukraine&rsquo;s chief prosecutor at the time, who, they claim, was investigating the company, although the accusation of corrupt intent and the claim that Shokin was investigating the energy company are both unsubstantiated. The claim that Ukraine was involved in 2016 election interference is also unsubstantiated. Giuliani told Fox News on Oct. 2, 2019, &ldquo;I explored [the accusation] as part of my duty as an attorney to show that the crimes committed, were not by my client, but by Democrats,&rdquo; and he tied his work to oust Ambassador Yovanovitch to his work to discredit Biden <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/the-ukrainian-prosecutor-behind-trumps-impeachment">in an interview with The New Yorker</a>. Giuliani continued to seek information from Ukrainian sources <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/13/21020584/trump-impeachment-articles-rudy-giuliani-ukraine">as late as December 2019</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">Lutsenko, the Ukrainian chief prosecutor who succeeded the ousted Shokin, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/hunter-biden-did-not-violate-anything-former-ukrainian-prosecutor-says-n1059136">said there was no evidence Biden or his son committed a crime</a>. George Kent, a deputy assistant Secretary of State, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D009.pdf">testified</a> on Oct. 15, 2019 that the State Department considered both Shokin and Lutsenko to be corrupt prosecutors. The April 10, 2019 call between Nunes and Giuliani was reported by the House Intelligence Committee report.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Ambassador fired</span> Then on <strong>May 20, 2019</strong>, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was fired allegedly for not pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden.</p>
        <p class="notes">This was first <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-ordered-ukraine-ambassador-removed-after-complaints-from-giuliani-others-11570137147?mod=trending_now_1">reported</a> on Oct. 3, 2019.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Military aid funding halted</span>  The U.S. provides significant funding to Ukraine to defend themselves from aggression by Russia, which in 2014 annexed the part of Ukraine called Crimea, although much of that aid actually goes to United States companies providing defense products and services. On <strong>July 3, 2019</strong>, President Trump ordered a hold on military aid funding to Ukraine with no explanation given to Ukraine or U.S. diplomats, but White House staff were told that it was because of a general concern about corruption in Ukraine. But because the aid was set in law and procedures for clearing the aid had already completed, including a Department of Defense certification, withholding the aid may have violated the law. In October 2019, Trump and the White House gave explanations that included <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-shifted-authority-over-ukraine-aid-amid-legal-concerns-11570717571">wanting European countries to do more</a> to support Ukraine and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/17/771095144/mulvaney-acknowledges-assistance-to-ukraine-was-tied-to-investigating-corruption">pressuring Ukraine to address broad corruption issues</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">This was first <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531">reported</a> on Aug. 28, 2019. Jennifer Williams, an advisor to Vice President Pence, <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/williams_final_version_with_letter.pdf">testified</a> on Nov. 7, 2019 that she was told that military aid was withheld on July 3, 2019. David Holmes, a foreign service officer working in Ukraine, testified that &ldquo;the order had come from the President&rdquo; and that the embassy in Ukraine found out on July 18. Tim Morrison, a White House advisor, also testified that the order had come from the Pressident and that the concern was about corruption generally. Williams also testified that the Department of Defense certified that the aid met U.S. policy goals with respect to corruption in Ukraine prior to July 3, 2019 and that the aid is spent significantly on U.S. defnese contractors, and Morrison testified that the Department of Defense believed it may have been illegal to withhold the military aid since the aid was specified in law.</p>

        <p><span class="header">The first &ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo;</span>  Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor who was appointed ambassador to the European Union (of which Ukraine is not a part) in 2018, was given some additional responsibility for relations with Ukraine after the position of ambassador to Ukraine become vacant. Then Sondland told Ukraine on <strong>July 10, 2019</strong> that an investigation into the energy company that made payments to Biden&rsquo;s son and alleged election interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election was a precondition for a coveted White House visit by Ukraine&rsquo;s president. Trump Administration officials continued to work on this deal throughout the summer in consultation with the President&rsquo;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, at the direction of the President. Giuliani separately communicated the demand for the investigation to Ukrainian officials. On July 25, 2019 (before the Trump-Zelenskyy call), volunteer special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told Ukraine President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s top adviser, in a text message, &ldquo;assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate . . . we will nail down date for visit to Washington.&rdquo; Ukraine agreed. In late August 2019, Sondland <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/sondland-pompeo-ukraine.html">got approval from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">Alexander Vindman, a White House adviser, and Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, first testified that an announcement of an investigation into the energy company tied to Biden&rsquo;s son was a precondition for the White House visit. Vindman testified about Sondland&rsquo;s communication to Ukraine. Sondland testified later that they intended to (but ultimately did not) ask Ukraine to announce that the investigation would be opened, and denied at first that it was in exchange for the White House visit, but later in his Nov. 20, 2019 public testimony called the request a &ldquo;quid pro quo.&rdquo; Volker provided the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">text messages</a> to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Oct. 3, 2019. Vindman&rsquo;s testimony was on Oct. 29, 2019. Sondland testified privately on Oct. 17, 2019 and publicly on Nov. 20, 2019. In his public testimony, he said that Giuliani separately communicated the demand to Ukraine, that Ukraine agreed to the demand, and that Sondland updated Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Trump-Zelenskyy call</span>  In a <strong>July 25, 2019</strong> call between President Trump and Ukraine&rsquo;s new President Zelenskyy, Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate alleged actions by Biden (&ldquo;Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution [into the Ukrainian energy company] so if you can look into it...,&rdquo; Trump said on the call) and to locate the Democratic National Committee (DNC)&rsquo;s 2016 email server (&ldquo;The server, they say Ukraine has it,&rdquo; Trump said), and to do both investigations in collaboration with Giuliani, the President&rsquo;s personal lawyer. (Although a consensus of nonpartisan and bipartisan investigations found that Russia hacked the DNC email server in an effort to help Trump win the 2016 election, Trump has pursued a discredited theory that it was hackers in Ukraine who helped him, not Russia itself.) Zelenskyy replies that they will &ldquo;look into the situation,&rdquo; and the next day, a top aid to Zelenskyy told Ambassador Sondland that they would do an investigation.
        Text messages among ambassadors after the call show a debate over whether Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine and an invitation to visit the White House in exchange for these investigations.
        Ukraine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/ukraine-aid-freeze-impeachment.html">found out about the hold</a> on military aid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/world/europe/ukraine-impeachment-military-aid.html">in the days after the July 25 call</a>, and Parnas, the businessman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/nyregion/trump-ukraine-parnas-fruman.html">said he had told Zelenskyy&rsquo;s associates</a> in May 2019 that the President would withhold military aid unless Ukraine announced it would begin these investigations, but others denied this.
       	Zelenskyy could have concluded that the requested investigation and the military aid were linked &mdash; either because of Parnas&rsquo;s message, the identical conditions placed by Ambassador Sondland on a White House visit, or by implication from the President&rsquo;s request and the timing of the withheld aid.</p>
        <p class="notes">On Sept. 25, 2019 the White House released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">summary of the Trump-Zelenskyy call</a>. Ambassador Kurt Volker provided the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">text messages</a> to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Oct. 3, 2019. David Holmes, a foreign service officer working in Ukraine at the time, testified that Ukraine agreed to do an investigation.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Whistleblower complaint</span>  A government employee whose identity has been withheld filed <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6430388/20190812-Whistleblower-Complaint-Unclass.pdf">a confidential whistleblower complaint</a> on <strong>Aug. 12, 2019</strong> alleging the President abused his power for political gain by targeting a potential election opponent. The complaint documented the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, efforts to restrict access to records related to the call, and connecting this to Giuliani&rsquo;s efforts to pressure Ukraine to open the investigations &mdash; all of which were later confirmed by the White House or by the testimony of impeachment inquiry witnesses. In the following weeks, Trump-appointed officials disagreed about whether to share the complaint with Congress and ultimately withheld it. In late August 2019, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/politics/trump-whistle-blower-complaint-ukraine.html">learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">The existence of the complaint was not known to the general public until Sept. 21, 2019, when key elements of the complaint were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176">leaked to the media</a>. The White House made <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6430388/20190812-Whistleblower-Complaint-Unclass.pdf">the complaint</a> available on Sept. 26, 2019. On Sept. 27, 2019, the White House confirmed that the Trump-Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-white-house/index.html">call summary was placed in a computer system meant for classified records</a>, and in his Oct. 31, 2019 testimony, Tim Morrison, a White House Advisor, said that <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/morrison_final_version.pdf">the White House stored Trump-Zelenskyy call record in the classified system because of a miscommunication</a> between White House staff about how to restrict access to it.</p>

        <p><span class="header">The second &ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo;</span>  On <strong>Sept. 1, 2019</strong>, Ambassador Sondland told Ukraine that military aid would be withheld unless Ukraine made a public statement that it would investigate the energy company that made payments to Biden&rsquo;s son and &ldquo;2016,&rdquo; referring to the 2016 hack of the DNC&rsquo;s email server, following a directive given by President Trump, and on Sept. 7, 2019, the President further directed that Zelenskyy himself must make the statement. Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky.html">planned to make the statement on CNN on Sept. 13, 2019</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a White House advisor, testified that the aid was in exchange for Ukraine investigating the energy company, on Oct. 22, 2019 and Oct. 31, 2019, respectively. Gordon Sondland initially denied that an investigation was contingent on military aid in his Oct. 17, 2019 testimony, saying the President told him &ldquo;There is no quid pro quo.&rdquo; But on Nov. 5, 2019, Sondland revised his testimony, saying that military aid had indeed been contingent on announcing an investigation into the energy company that made payments to Biden&rsquo;s son and &ldquo;2016,&rdquo; referring to the 2016 hack of the DNC&rsquo;s email server. Morrison further testified that Sondland told him shortly after the Sept. 1, 2019 meeting that the link between aid and the investigation was President Trump&rsquo;s position, and that Sondland told him on Sept. 7, 2019 that President Trump wanted Zelenskyy himself to make the statement. In his Nov. 20, 2019, Sondland testified that he told Vice President Pence on Aug. 30, 2019 that he believed the aid was tied to the investigations into the Ukrainian energy company and the DNC email server.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Investigation begins</span>  On <strong>Sept. 5, 2019</strong>, The Washington Post reported for the first time <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/is-trump-strong-arming-ukraines-new-president-for-political-gain/2019/09/05/4eb239b0-cffa-11e9-8c1c-7c8ee785b855_story.html">a possible link between the cut military aid and an investigation into Biden</a>. Then on <strong>Sept. 9, 2019</strong> the House Intelligence, Foreign Relations, and Oversight committees <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/2019/9/three-house-committees-launch-wide-ranging-investigation-into-trump-giuliani-ukraine-scheme">announced an investigation</a> into President Trump&rsquo;s requests to Zelenskyy on the July 25, 2019 call, which had been made public by the Ukrainian government but not yet by the White House, and the committees accused Trump of withholding the military aid for political reasons. (At this time, few other facts were known publicly about the events in this chronology &mdash; the existence of the whistleblower complaint would not become publicly known until several weeks later.)</p>

        <p><span class="header">Restoration of military aid</span>  On <strong>Sept. 11, 2019</strong>, Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) met with the President and Vice President to urge the President to lift the hold on the military aid, likely conveying <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531">pressure from legislators in Congress</a> who did not yet know for sure about the investigations the President asked Ukraine to do but likely believed that by withholding aid the White House was wavering in its support for Ukraine against Russia. (He likely also read the Sept. 5, 2019 Washington Post article and it is possible he confronted the President about it.) Immediately after the meeting, the withheld military aid was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/bill-taylor-opening-statement-congress/index.html">ordered restored</a>. Even after the aid was restored, Ambassador Sondland still believed as late as Sept. 13, 2019 that Zelenskyy was going to make the statement on CNN, according to the testimony of David Holmes, the foreign service officer. Ultimately, Zelenskyy did not make the statement on Sept. 13, but on Oct. 4, 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/world/europe/ukraine-biden-burisma.html">Ukraine said it would open the investigation</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">Because the federal government allocates funding in yearly increments with fiscal years ending at the end of each September, after Sept. 15, 2019 the funding for the aid would have expired and aid would not have been able to be restored without a new law passed by Congress. For reasons unknown, Congress <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr4378">did pass a bill</a>, which Trump signed into law on Sept. 27, 2019, extending the deadline to release the aid for another year. Morrison testified about Zelenskyy&rsquo;s success implementing corruption reforms and a Sept. 15, 2019 deadline for releasing the aid. Holmes testified on Nov. 15, 2019.</p>
        <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
	        <p>The reason for the order to restore the military aid is not yet known but there are many possible explanations:</p>
	        <ol>
	       	<li>Zelenskyy agreed to the White House&rsquo;s conditions for restoring the aid in early September.</li>
	        <li>Over the summer of 2019, Zelenskyy had made significant progress implementing corruption reforms possibly convincing President Trump that continued support for Ukraine would be appropriate.</li>
	       	<li>The White House may have changed course as a result of pressure from legislators in Congress who wanted support for Ukraine against Russian aggression to continue.</li>
	       	<li>A Sept. 15, 2019 legal deadline was approaching after which aid could not be given. The deadline stemmed from the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 and a requirement that the White House notify Congress before releasing the aid.</li>
	       	<li>The House committees&rsquo; new investigation, the Sept. 5, 2019 Washington Post article, or the existence of the whistleblower complaint may have worried President Trump that if further information became public he might face consequences for the appearance of mixing politics with foreign affairs.</li>

        <p><span class="header">Depositions</span>  During <strong>October 2019</strong>, congressional committees conducted <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-tracker">thirteen private interviews and briefings</a> with Trump Administration officials. Ambassador Taylor said in his opening statement on Oct. 22, 2019 that Volker, Sondland, Secretary Rick Perry, Sen. Ron Johnson, and Giuliani began an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/bill-taylor-deposition-text-messages/index.html">&ldquo;irregular&rdquo; circumvention of normal State Department relations</a> with Ukraine to push investigations related to Biden and the 2016 hack of the DNC email server. Private interviews are a <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/95-949.html">standard procedure</a> for committee investigations, especially when national security interests are involved, and <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45731.html#_Toc12535700">the full House most recently re-authorized their use on Jan. 9, 2019</a>. Both parties participated in the interviews. Transcripts of the depositions were made available to the public within several weeks after the deposition (<a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/67076/public-document-clearinghouse-ukraine-impeachment-inquiry/#WitnessTestimony">read them all</a>).</p>

        <p><span class="header">Public hearings &amp; report</span>  The House Committee on Intelligence held public hearings between <strong>Nov. 13, 2019</strong> and Nov. 21, 2019. Little new information was revealed as the transcripts of the private depositions of the witnesses had already been made publicly available. No witness testified that President Trump himself directed that either the White House visit or the military aid be conditioned on the two requested investigations, but that Giuliani, Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer, made the directive on Trump&rsquo;s behalf instead &mdash; leaving it unclear if the President desired a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, most witnesses testified that the President&rsquo;s requests alone were improper, whether or not they were a part of a quid pro quo. On <strong>Dec. 3, 2019</strong>, the Intelligence Committee released its <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191203_-_full_report___hpsci_impeachment_inquiry_-_20191203.pdf">report of findings</a>, which accused the President of soliciting foreign help for his 2020 reelection, withholding from Ukraine official government actions to do so, and obstructing the impeachment investigation.</p>

        <h1>
          Charges against President Trump
        </h1>

        <p style="margin: 2em 0;">The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach &mdash; or charge &mdash; a president and other government officials for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The House is considering the charges below.</p>

        <h2>What is impeachable?</h2>

        <p>Although <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/americans-have-forgotten-what-treason-actually-means-how-it-can-ncna848651">treason is defined in the Constitution</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201">bribery is defined by a criminal statute</a>, “high crimes and misdemeanors” was left open to interpretation. Based on historical statements by framers of the Constitution and subsequent practice by Congress, impeachment is <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44260.html#_Toc433996057">not limited to criminal acts</a>. Courts have also determined that Congress&rsquo;s choice to impeach and remove an official is <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44260.html#_Toc433996075">not subject to review by courts</a>. Therefore, Congress may remove a president or official for any reason or no reason at all.</p>

        <p>Instead of looking at what&rsquo;s legal (since any basis for impeachment and removal is legal), one can also look at what&rsquo;s normal. President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1867 over his firing of his Secretary of War &mdash; the House of Representatives viewed the action as a violation of the Tenure of Office Act, while Johnson considered the Act unconstitutional. The Senate found Johnson not guilty. (Interestingly, the Tenure of Office Act was later repealed, and the Supreme Court took Johnson&rsquo;s position in a similar case in the next century.) The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998 for lying to a grand jury and obstruction of justice related to a matter unrelated to his official duties and for which there was no underlying crime. The Senate found Clinton not guilty. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended that President Richard Nixon be impeached for obstructing an investigation into criminal activities by his administration and re-election campaign, abuse of power, and not complying with subpoenas. Nixon resigned before the full House took any action.</p>

        <h2>What charges are being considered for President Trump?</h2>

        <p>The House Committee on the Judiciary recommended that the House of Representatives impeach the president for &ldquo;high crimes and misdemeanors&rdquo; based on two charges discussed below.</p>

        <h3>Abuse of Power</h3>

        <p>Article I of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hres755">articles of impeachment</a> is &ldquo;abuse of power.&rdquo; This charge alleges that President Trump “solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election” for “personal political benefit” by asking Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and a discredited theory of 2016 election interference by Ukraine:</p>

        <p><span class="header">Foreign assistance in the election</span></p>

        <p>The White House has said that in a July 25, 2019 phone call, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">President Trump asked Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy for a “favor”</a> to investigate the President’s chief political opponent at the time, former vice president Joe Biden (&ldquo;Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution [into the Ukrainian energy company that paid his son] so if you can look into it...,&rdquo; Trump said on the call) and to locate the Democratic National Committee (DNC)’s 2016 email server (&ldquo;The server, they say Ukraine has it,&rdquo; Trump said on the call). The President asked Zelenskyy to coordinate the investigations with the President’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-prosecutor-biden-burisma-back-off-state-department-files">who told Fox News on Oct. 2, 2019</a>, &ldquo;I explored [the accusation] as part of my duty as an attorney to show that the crimes committed, were not by my client, but by Democrats.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Trump and his associates accuse Biden of using his position as vice president, around 2016, to help a Ukrainian energy company which made payments to his son, although the accusation is unsubstantiated. Although the President has said he asked Zelenskyy for a legitimate investigation into corrupt acts by Biden, whether or not Biden acted improperly is not actually at issue. The President&rsquo;s motivation is the central component of this charge. The President’s focus on domestic issues related to the 2016 presidential election (in which he won) and a likely candidate in the 2020 presidential election (who he will likely run against), and not any other corruption in Ukraine, and the involvement of the President’s personal lawyer who said he is pursuing a partisan resolution on these issues, suggest the President’s motivation may have been political.</p>

        <p>Foreign entities are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121">prohibited by law</a> from making contributions to political campaigns, including by providing favors of material value. Abuse of power is also a crime.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Soliciting bribery</span></p>

        <p>Although the article does not make a charge under the Constitution&rsquo;s &ldquo;bribery&rdquo; ground for impeachment, the article does lay out key elements of soliciting a bribe. The President “acting both directly and through his agents,” meaning through his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, made a White House visit and military aid conditioned on the investigations, with “corrupt motives,” meaning for personal gain, the article reads.</p>

        <p>One of the President’s foreign policy goals has been to get European countries to step up their support for military security, rather than relying on the United States. According to the White House, in the July 25, 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">Trump-Zelenskyy phone call</a>, the President told Zelenskyy that he thought the United States’s security aid to Ukraine made the nations’ relationship not “reciprocal,” and then in his next sentence asked Zelenskyy for the “favor” described above. Trump told Zelenskyy, &ldquo;it’s very important that you do it.&rdquo; Although not stated directly during the call, Zelenskyy may have understood the President as asking Ukraine to make the relationship reciprocal by performing the favor in exchange for something else.</p>

        <p>Prior to the call, on July 10, 2019, Ambassador Gordon Sondland told a high-ranking Ukrainian official that a previously extended invitation for Zelenzyy to meet President Trump at the White House was on the condition that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden, and Sondland testified that Rudy Giuliani, the President&rsquo;s personal lawyer, separately communicated the demand for the investigation to Ukrainian officials. On Sept. 1, 2019, Sondland told Ukrainian officials that the military aid was withheld on the same condition &mdash; although Zelenskyy may have already came to that conclusion in late July or August. Lev Parnas, the businessman and associate of President Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer, said he had also told Zelenskyy&rsquo;s associates in May 2019 that the President would withhold military aid unless Ukraine announced it would begin these investigations, but others denied this. Zelenskyy likely understood by late July that both the White House visit and the military aid were likely contingent on the requested investigations.</p>

        <p>Quid pro quo &mdash; a fancy word for bribery &mdash; is a generally accepted tool in foreign policy and well within the President’s foreign policy powers so long as the President is conducting foreign affairs. The article of impeachment charges that the President requested the favor with corrupt intent, i.e. to benefit personally, and therefore not as a part of the President&rsquo;s foreign policy powers. However, there is no hard evidence that Sondland&rsquo;s communications to Ukraine were at the direction of the President.</p>

        <h3>Obstruction of Congress</h3>

        <p>Article II of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hres755">articles of impeachment</a> is &ldquo;obstruction of Congress.&rdquo; In October 2019, the White House sent a letter to the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry stating that it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/politics/wh-letter-to-pelosi/index.html">would not respond to the committees&rsquo; subpoenas</a> because, it said, the House was not affording the President due process rights as he would have in a criminal trial, such as the ability to question witnesses. (The metaphor does not hold, since an impeachment inquiry is not a criminal trial and is more parallel to a police investigation prior to charges being filed, in which would-be defendants have no such rights. When the committees provided the President an opportunity to participate during the public hearings, the President declined.) Failure to comply with a congressional subpoena <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45653.html">is a crime</a>, and refusal to cooperate with subpoenas was an impeachment charge in <a href="https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment">the case of President Richard Nixon</a>.</p>     

        <p>Abuse of power, soliciting a bribe, and obstruction of Congress are all crimes under the law. But because impeachment need not be for violation of specific criminal statutes, articles of impeachment traditionally do not charge volations of particular statutory crimes. It is up to the Senate to decide whether the actions by the President described in the articles of impeachment meet the Constitution&rsquo;s bar for &ldquo;high crimes and misdemeanors.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>Potential charges that were not included in the articles of impeachment</h2>

        <p>The House is not considering the following other potential charges that we had listed here prior to the charges being announced:</p>

       	<p><span class="header">Misuse of funds</span> Because the military aid for Ukraine was set in law, and procedures for clearing the aid had already been completed by the President&rsquo;s own advisors, including a Department of Defense certification, withholding the aid <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/dec/05/did-trump-violate-impoundment-control-act/">may have violated law</a>. The House Committee on Intelligence&rsquo;s report alleged that the law was violated, but this allegation was not included in the House Judicary Committee&rsquo;s articles of impeachment.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Coverup &ndash; Mishandling records</span> The White House&rsquo;s record of the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelenskyy phone call <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-white-house/index.html">was filed in a location meant for highly classified materials</a>, the White House confirmed, even though the call did not involve classified information, in order to restrict access to it. In his Oct. 31, 2019 testimony, Tim Morrison, a White House Advisor, said that <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/morrison_final_version.pdf">the White House stored Trump-Zelenskyy call record in the classified system because of a miscommunication</a> between White House staff about how to restrict access to it to prevent the call from becoming a political issue &mdash; confirming that the action was both unusual and with the intent to restrict access. It was also reported that a transcript of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html">a call with China</a> was placed in the same system. Several laws including the Presidential Records Act require presidential records like the call record to be preserved but may not require that the records be stored in any particular electronic system.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Coverup &ndash; Withholding Whistleblower Report, Retaliation</span> A federal employee submitted a confidential complaint to his superiors on Aug. 12, 2019, and key elements of the complaint were leaked to the media &mdash; not by the whistleblower &mdash; and made public by the White House in the months that followed. Although the whistleblower report was deemed by a Trump-appointed nonpartisan civil servant to be credible (and, indeed, the key allegations in the report were confirmed by the White House and other officials), it was withheld from Congress by a Trump-appointed political appointee, the Director of National Intelligence, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/22/whistleblower-complaint-has-congress-trump-an-impasse-heres-what-law-says/">possibly in violation of existing law</a> that requires that credible complaints be forwarded confidentially to Congress. Federal law also prohibits federal agencies from retaliating against whistleblowers, in order to encourage whistleblowers to come forward. The President repeatedly called for the whistleblower&rsquo;s identity to be revealed, possibly in violation of whistleblower protection law.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Emoluments</span> According to the White House, in the July 25, 2019 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">Zelenskyy said he had stayed at the President’s Trump Tower property</a> on his last visit to the United States, among other thanks and praise, to which the President responded positively.  Since the President personally benefits from business at his properties, foreign leaders’ stays at his properties may be a constitutionally prohibited emolument.</p>

        <h1>
          How Impeachment &amp; Removal Works
        </h1>

        <p>Impeachment is the first step in the Constitutional process for Congress to remove the president or other government officers. Although the Constitution sets a broad two-step process for impeachment and removal, there are many steps that have evolved from previous times impeachment and removal have been used on lower government officers, such as judges. No president has ever been removed from office.</p>

        <p>Below you&rsquo;ll find a simplified timeline of how impeachment and removal works, and some links to research reports that provide more detailed information.</p>

        <h2>A Simple Timeline for Impeachment and Removal</h2>

    <h3>Impeachment in the House of Representatives</h3>
    <p><span class="header2">① Impeachment Inquiry</span> On Sept. 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will move forward with an official impeachment inquiry. This announcement alone is enough to begin official impeachment proceedings, starting with the directive that six House committees continue their investigations of the President “under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.”</p>
    <p><span class="header2">② Investigative Authority</span> In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/politics/trump-impeachment-definition.html">cases of Presidents Nixon and Clinton</a>, a resolution was necessary to grant the House Judiciary Committee with authorities to conduct an investigation into impeachment. However, under the current House rules, the committee already has those authorities.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">③ Committee Reports</span> After investigating, committees will report their findings to the House as a whole. In the past, the House Judiciary Committee has voted on whether to recommend impeachment and has reported an impeachment resolution with specific allegations of misconduct. Each investigating committee may report separate findings. <b style="color: rgb(175, 33, 70)">&larr; We are here.</b></p>
    <p><span class="header2">④ Vote on Impeachment</span> The House would then vote on an impeachment resolution containing articles of impeachment, which are the charges of misconduct. This vote only requires a simple majority for passage. If passed, the subject of the inquiry is impeached &mdash; which means the matter is referred next to the Senate.</p>

    <h3>Trial in the Senate</h3>
    <p><span class="header2">⑤ Preparation for a Trial</span> If the House chooses to impeach, there will be a trial in the Senate to determine if the President is guilty. To start this process, the House will select “managers” to present evidence to the Senate and to subpoena witnesses, and the Senate will issue a writ of summons to the impeached official to appear.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">⑥ Trial</span> The trial is roughly analogous to a criminal court trial, with the House managers playing the role of the prosecution, the Senate as the jury, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as the judge, and the impeached official is the defendant. However, the Constitution is clear that it is not a criminal trial, since the standards for evidence and conviction are up to the Senate.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">⑦ Deliberation</span> Similar to a jury, the Senate meets in closed session to deliberate the substance of the trial.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">⑧ Vote on Conviction</span> Finally, the Senate votes on each article of impeachment separately. These votes require a ⅔rd majority to convict, which results in removal from office.  The Senate may also vote on whether the convicted official becomes disqualified from holding a government position again, for which only a simple majority is required.</p>

    <h3>Appealing a Conviction</h3>
    <p><span class="header2">⑨ Judicial Review</span> Impeachment proceedings have been challenged in federal court on a number of occasions. In the unlikely event that the president is impeached and the Senate convicts him, there may be lawsuits to appeal the conviction. However, courts have said in the past that Congress&rsquo;s power to impeach is broad and in many cases is not subject to judicial review.</p>
