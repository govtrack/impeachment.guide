            <p>An <b>impeachment inquiry</b> is a process in the House of Representatives
            to determine whether to vote on impeachment and, if so, on what grounds. If the
            inquiry leads to a vote on impeachment, and if a majority of representatives
            vote yes, then the president is impeached, which only means that the matter is referred
            to the Senate for a trial. After that, if two-thirds of senators also vote yes, only
            then would the president be removed from office, and the vice president would become
            the president.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
      	<p><span class="header">Ambassador targeted by Ukraine</span>  Lev Parnas, an American citizen and businessman born in Ukraine, and an associate of his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-sessions-lev-parnas-igor-fruman-contributions-donated">made significant illegal campaign contributions</a> in <strong>June 2018</strong> to former Rep. Pete Sessions and related political entities as a part of a plan to influence the United States government to replace U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, according to charges filed by the Justice Department. The plan was reportedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/lutsenko-unnamed-ukrainian-who-led-plot-oust-yovanovitch-says-official-n1065246">at the request of Ukraine&rsquo;s former chief prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko</a>. Later that year, Parnas <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-giuliani-excl/exclusive-trump-lawyer-giuliani-was-paid-500000-to-consult-on-indicted-associates-firm-idUSKBN1WU07Z">hired President Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani</a>, and Giuliani met with Lutsenko about the plan, according to deputy assistant Secretary of State George Kent. On <strong>Jan. 9, 2019</strong> Giuliani asked the State Department to issue Viktor Shokin, Lutsenko&rsquo;s predecessor as Ukraine&rsquo;s chief prosecutor, a visa to travel to the United States so that he could provide information about corruption in the United States, according to Kent, possibly referring to the same plan to oust Yovanovitch.</p>
      	<p class="notes">Parnas was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/lev-parnas-and-igor-fruman-charged-conspiring-violate-straw-and-foreign-donor-bans">charged with conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations in federal elections</a> on Oct. 10, 2019. George Kent, a deputy assistant Secretary of State, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D009.pdf">testified</a> on Oct. 15, 2019 that Lutsenko had planned a May 2018 meeting with President Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, for an unknown purpose, but that the meeting never ocurred, and that they later met in early 2019, and that Giuliani asked the State Department to issue a visa to Shokin.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Political research</span>  Around <strong>May 2019</strong>, President Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was working on behalf of the President and in collaboration with Parnas, the businessman, to persuade <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-prosecutor-biden-burisma-back-off-state-department-files">the State Department</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/us/politics/giuliani-ukraine-trump.html">Ukrainian officials</a> to investigate actions by former Vice President Joe Biden, the President&rsquo;s chief 2020 election rival at the time, and his son. Trump and his associates accuse Biden of using his position as vice president, around 2016, to help a Ukrainian energy company which made payments to his son by ousting Shokin, Ukraine&rsquo;s chief prosecutor at the time, who, they claim, was investigating the company, although the accusation of corrupt intent and the claim that Shoken was investigating the energy company are both unsubstantiated. Giuliani told Fox News on Oct. 2, 2019, &ldquo;I explored [the accusation] as part of my duty as an attorney to show that the crimes committed, were not by my client, but by Democrats.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="notes">Lutsenko, the Ukrainian chief prosecutor who succeeded the ousted Shokin, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/hunter-biden-did-not-violate-anything-former-ukrainian-prosecutor-says-n1059136">said there was no evidence Biden or his son committed a crime</a>. George Kent, a deputy assistant Secretary of State, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D009.pdf">testified</a> on Oct. 15, 2019 that the State Department considered both Shokin and Lutsenko to be corrupt prosecutors.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Ambassador fired</span> Then on <strong>May 20, 2019</strong>, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was fired allegedly for not pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden.</p>
        <p class="notes">This was first <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-ordered-ukraine-ambassador-removed-after-complaints-from-giuliani-others-11570137147?mod=trending_now_1">reported</a> on Oct. 3, 2019.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Military aid funding halted</span>  The U.S. provides significant funding to Ukraine to defend themselves from aggression by Russia, which in 2014 annexed the part of Ukraine called Crimea, although much of that aid actually goes to United States companies providing defense products and services. On <strong>July 3, 2019</strong>, President Trump ordered a hold on military aid funding to Ukraine with no explanation given to Ukraine or U.S. diplomats, but White House staff were told that it was because of a general concern about corruption in Ukraine. In October 2019, Trump and the White House gave explanations that included <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-shifted-authority-over-ukraine-aid-amid-legal-concerns-11570717571">wanting European countries to do more</a> to support Ukraine and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/17/771095144/mulvaney-acknowledges-assistance-to-ukraine-was-tied-to-investigating-corruption">pressuring Ukraine to address broad corruption issues</a>.</p>

Jennifer Williams, an advisor to Vice President Pence, <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/williams_final_version_with_letter.pdf">testified</a> on Nov. 7, 2019 that she was told that military aid was withheld on July 3, 2019. David Holmes, a foreign service officer working in Ukraine, testified that &ldquo;the order had come from the President&rdquo; and that the embassy in Ukraine found out on July 18. Tim Morrison, a White House advisor, also testified that the order had come from the Pressident and that the concern was about corruption generally. Williams also testified that the Department of Defense certified that the aid met U.S. policy goals with respect to corruption in Ukraine prior to July 3, 2019 and that the aid is spent significantly on U.S. defnese contractors, and Morrison testified that the Department of Defense believed it may have been illegal to withhold the military aid since the aid was specified in law.</p>

Then on July 25, 2019 (before the Trump-Zelenskyy call), volunteer special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker told Ukraine President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s top adviser, in a text message, &ldquo;assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate . . . we will nail down date for visit to Washington.&rdquo;
    	</p>
        <p class="notes">Alexander Vindman, a White House adviser, and Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, testified that an announcement of an investigation into the energy company tied to Biden&rsquo;s son was a precondition for the White House visit. Vindman testified about Sondland&rsquo;s communication to Ukraine. Sondland testified later that they intended to (but ultimately did not) ask Ukraine to announce that the investigation would be opened, denied that it was in exchange for the White House visit, but nevertheless felt, in retrospect, that the request alone would have been &ldquo;improper&rdquo; because of its relevance to the upcoming 2020 election. Volker provided the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">text messages</a> to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Oct. 3, 2019.

        <p><span class="header">Trump-Zelenskyy call</span>  In a <strong>July 25, 2019</strong> call between President Trump and Ukraine&rsquo;s new President Zelenskyy, Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate alleged actions by Biden (&ldquo;Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution [into the Ukrainian energy company] so if you can look into it...,&rdquo; Trump said on the call) and to locate the Democratic National Committee (DNC)&rsquo;s 2016 email server (&ldquo;The server, they say Ukraine has it,&rdquo; Trump said), which was hacked by Russia in an effort to help the President win the 2016 election, and to do both investigations in collaboration with Giuliani, the President&rsquo;s personal lawyer. Zelenskyy replies that they will &ldquo;look into the situation&rdquo; related to the Ukrainian energy company that Biden is accused of helping.
        The next day, a top aid to Zelenskyy told Ambassador Sondland that they would do an investigation, according to the testimony of David Holmes, a foreign service officer working in Ukraine at the time.</p>
        <p><span class="header">Did Zelenskyy connect the request to withheld military aid?</span>  Text messages among ambassadors after the call show a debate over whether Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine and an invitation to visit the White House in exchange for these investigations. And although Ukraine had already been told that the White House visit was on the condition of performing one of the investigations, it&rsquo;s not clear whether or when Zelenskyy believed that it was a precondition for military aid as well.
        Parnas, the businessman, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/nyregion/trump-ukraine-parnas-fruman.html">said he had told Zelenskyy&rsquo;s associates</a> in May 2019 that the President would withhold military aid unless Ukraine announced it would begin these investigations, but others denied this.
       	Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/ukraine-aid-freeze-impeachment.html">learned that the military aid had been put on hold</a> only several weeks after the call, and may have concluded that it was related to the requested investigations &mdash; perhaps because of Parnas&rsquo;s message, the conditions placed by Ambassador Sondland on a White House visit, or by implication from the President&rsquo;s request.</p>
        <p class="notes">On Sept. 25, 2019 the White House released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">summary of the Trump-Zelenskyy call</a>. Ambassador Kurt Volker provided the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">text messages</a> to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Oct. 3, 2019.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Whistleblower complaint</span>  A government employee whose identity has been withheld filed <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6430388/20190812-Whistleblower-Complaint-Unclass.pdf">a confidential whistleblower complaint</a> on <strong>Aug. 12, 2019</strong> alleging the President abused his power for political gain by targeting a potential election opponent. The complaint documented the Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, efforts to restrict access to records related to the call, and connecting this to Giuliani&rsquo;s efforts to pressure Ukraine to open the investigations &mdash; all of which were later confirmed by the White House or by the testimony of impeachment inquiry witnesses. In the following weeks, Trump-appointed officials disagreed about whether to share the complaint with Congress and ultimately withheld it.</p>
        <p class="notes">The existence of the complaint was not known until Sept. 21, 2019, when key elements of the complaint were <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176">leaked to the media</a>. The White House made <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6430388/20190812-Whistleblower-Complaint-Unclass.pdf">the complaint</a> available on Sept. 26, 2019. On Sept. 27, 2019, the White House confirmed that the Trump-Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-white-house/index.html">call summary was placed in a computer system meant for classified records</a>, and in his Oct. 31, 2019 testimony, Tim Morrison, a White House Advisor, said that <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/morrison_final_version.pdf">the White House stored Trump-Zelenskyy call record in the classified system because of a miscommunication</a> between White House staff about how to restrict access to it.</p>

        <p><span class="header">The second &ldquo;quid pro quo&rdquo;</span>  On <strong>Sept. 1, 2019</strong>, Ambassador Sondland told Ukraine that military aid would be withheld unless Ukraine made a public statement that it would investigate the energy company that made payments to Biden&rsquo;s son and &ldquo;2016,&rdquo; referring to the 2016 hack of the DNC&rsquo;s email server, following a directive given by President Trump, and on Sept. 7, 2019, the President further directed that Zelenskyy himself must make the statement. Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky.html">planned to make the statement on CNN on Sept. 13, 2019</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">Ambassador Bill Taylor, the top diplomat in Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a White House advisor, testified that the aid was in exchange for Ukraine investigating the energy company, on Oct. 22, 2019 and Oct. 31, 2019, respectively. Gordon Sondland initially denied that an investigation was contingent on military aid in his Oct. 17, 2019 testimony, saying the President told him &ldquo;There is no quid pro quo.&rdquo; But on Nov. 5, 2019, Sondland revised his testimony, saying that military aid had indeed been contingent on announcing an investigation into the energy company that made payments to Biden&rsquo;s son and &ldquo;2016,&rdquo; referring to the 2016 hack of the DNC&rsquo;s email server. Morrison further testified that Sondland told him shortly after the Sept. 1, 2019 meeting that the link between aid and the investigation was President Trump&rsquo;s position, and that Sondland told him on Sept. 7, 2019 that President Trump wanted Zelenskyy himself to make the statement.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Investigation begins</span>  On Sept. 9, 2019 the House Intelligence, Foreign Relations, and Oversight committees launched an investigation into President Trump and Giuliani&rsquo;s efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Ukrainian energy company, which had been widely reported in news reports throughout the year.</p>
        <p class="notes">The three House committees&rsquo; investigation was revealed in a staff question to Morrison during Morrison&rsquo;s deposition.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Restoration of military aid</span>  On Sept. 11, 2019, Sen. Portman met with the President and Vice President to urge the President to lift the hold on the military aid, likely conveying <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531">pressure from legislators in Congress</a> who did not yet know about the investigations the President asked Ukraine to do but believed that by withholding aid the White House was wavering in its support for Ukraine against Russia. Immediately after the meeting, the withheld military aid was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/bill-taylor-opening-statement-congress/index.html">ordered restored</a>. The reason for this is not yet known but there are several explanations. Over the summer of 2019, Zelenskyy had made significant progress implementing corruption reforms, or the White House may have changed course as a result of pressure from legislators in Congress, or because a Sept. 15, 2019 legal deadline was approaching after which aid could not be given, or becaues of the House committees&rsquo; new investigation, or it is possible the White House knew the existence of the whistleblower complaint was about to become public, or because Zelenskyy had agreed to the White House&rsquo;s terms for restoring the aid. Even after the aid was restored, Ambassador Sondland still believed as late as Sept. 13, 2019 that Zelenskyy was going to make the statement on CNN, according to the testimony of David Holmes, the foreign service officer. Ultimately, Zelenskyy did not make the statement on Sept. 13, but on Oct. 4, 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/world/europe/ukraine-biden-burisma.html">Ukraine said it would open the investigation</a>.</p>
        <p class="notes">Morrison testified about Zelenskyy&rsquo;s success implementing corruption reforms and the Sept. 15, 2019 deadline. Holmes testified on Nov. 15, 2019.</a>

        <h1>
          Possible Impeachment Charges
        </h1>

        <p style="margin: 2em 0;">The Constitution gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach &mdash; or charge &mdash; a president and other government officials for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” (If the House votes to impeach, the charges go to the Senate for a trial to determine if the official should be removed from office. See <a href="#howitworks">How Impeachment Works</a>.) Below we list some of the charges that the House of Representatives may consider.</p>

        <h2>What is impeachable?</h2>

        <p>Although <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/americans-have-forgotten-what-treason-actually-means-how-it-can-ncna848651">treason is defined in the Constitution</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201">bribery is defined by a criminal statute</a>, “high crimes and misdemeanors” was left open to interpretation. Based on historical statements by framers of the Constitution and subsequent practice by Congress, impeachment is <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44260.html#_Toc433996057">not limited to criminal acts</a>. Courts have also determined that Congress&rsquo;s choice to impeach and remove an official is <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44260.html#_Toc433996075">not subject to review by courts</a>. Therefore, Congress may remove a president or official for any reason or no reason at all.</p>

        <p>Instead of looking at what&rsquo;s legal (since any basis for impeachment and removal is legal), one can also look at what&rsquo;s normal. President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1867 over his firing of his Secretary of War &mdash; the House of Representatives viewed the action as a violation of the Tenure of Office Act, while Johnson considered the Act unconstitutional. The Senate found Johnson not guilty. (Interestingly, the Tenure of Office Act was later repealed, and the Supreme Court took Johnson&rsquo;s position in a similar case in the next century.) The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton in 1998 for lying to a grand jury and obstruction of justice related to a matter unrelated to his official duties and for which there was no underlying crime. The Senate found Clinton not guilty. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee recommended that President Richard Nixon be impeached for obstructing an investigation into criminal activities by his administration and re-election campaign, abuse of power, and not complying with subpoenas. Nixon resigned before the full House took any action.</p>

        <h2>What charges are being considered for President Trump?</h2>

        <p><span class="header">Foreign assistance in the election</span> The White House has said that in a July 25, 2019 phone call, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">President Trump asked Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy for a “favor”</a> to investigate the President’s chief political opponent at the time, former vice president Joe Biden (&ldquo;Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution [into the Ukrainian energy company that paid his son] so if you can look into it...,&rdquo; Trump said on the call) and to locate the Democratic National Committee (DNC)’s 2016 email server (&ldquo;The server, they say Ukraine has it,&rdquo; Trump said on the call). The President asked Zelenskyy to coordinate the investigations with the President’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-prosecutor-biden-burisma-back-off-state-department-files">who told Fox News on Oct. 2, 2019</a>, &ldquo;I explored [the accusation] as part of my duty as an attorney to show that the crimes committed, were not by my client, but by Democrats.&rdquo; Trump and his associates accuse Biden of using his position as vice president, around 2016, to help a Ukrainian energy company which made payments to his son, although the accusation is unsubstantiated. Although the President has said he asked Zelenskyy for a legitimate investigation into corrupt acts by Biden, whether or not Biden acted improperly is not actually at issue. The President&rsquo;s motivation is the central component of this potential charge. The President’s focus on domestic issues related to the 2016 presidential election (in which he won) and a likely candidate in the 2020 presidential election (who he will likely run against), and not any other corruption in Ukraine, and the involvement of the President’s personal lawyer who said he is being paid to pursue partisan goals, suggest the President’s motivation may have been political. Foreign entities are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121">prohibited by law</a> from making contributions to political campaigns, including by providing favors of material value, and an impeachment charge could be based on a violation of law or perceived norms for foreign interference in elections or abuse of power.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Quid pro quo</span> One of the President’s foreign policy goals has been to get European countries to step up their support for military security, rather than relying on the United States. According to the White House, in the July 25, 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">Trump-Zelenskyy phone call</a>, the President told Zelenskyy that he thought the United States’s security aid to Ukraine made the nations’ relationship not “reciprocal,” and then in his next sentence asked Zelenskyy for the “favor” described above. Trump told Zelenskyy, &ldquo;it’s very important that you do it.&rdquo; Additionally, prior to the call, on July 10, 2019, Ambassador Gordon Sondland told a high-ranking Ukrainian official that a previously extended invitation for Zelenzyy to meet President Trump at the White House was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/us/politics/vindman-statement-impeachment.html">on the condition that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden</a>, according to testimony by White House adviser Alexandar Vindman. On the Trump-Zelenskyy call, Zelenskyy replies that they will &ldquo;look into the situation&rdquo; related to the Ukrainian energy company that Biden is accused of helping. Although not stated in clear words on the call, Zelenskyy may have understood the President as asking Ukraine to make the relationship reciprocal by performing the favor in exchange for either the military aid that Ukraine already receives from the United States or for a meeting with Trump at the White House &mdash; a quid pro quo. Quid pro quo is a generally accepted tool in foreign policy and well within the President’s foreign policy powers &mdash; so long as the President is conducting foreign affairs. If an investigation into Biden is deemed to be a political or domestic matter, and not a legitimate foreign policy goal, an impeachment charge might be based on violating bribery law, abuse of power, or the norms around the President not interfering in domestic law enforcement cases.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Extortion</span> On July 18, 2019, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/trump-shifts-explanation-for-withholding-ukraine-aid-69864517615">the President had halted military security aid to Ukraine</a>, and the President&rsquo;s ambassador to the European Union told Zelenskyy in September 2019 that the military aid was withheld until Ukraine announced an investigation into the energy company tied to Joe Biden&rsquo;s son, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/bill-taylor-deposition-text-messages/index.html">Ambassador Bill Taylor in his deposition</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-morrison-testimony-read-the-full-text-of-white-house-officials-opening-statement-to-impeachment-committees-today/">Tim Morrison, a White House advisor, in his deposition</a>. Withholding aid and a White House visit to coerce Ukraine to perform an investigation is extortion, but extortion is a generally accepted tool in foreign policy and well within the President’s foreign policy powers &mdash; so long as the President is conducting foreign affairs. If an investigation into Biden is deemed to be a political or domestic matter, and not a legitimate foreign policy goal, an impeachment charge might be based on extortion, which is a crime.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Emoluments</span> According to the White House, in the July 25, 2019 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">Zelenskyy said he had stayed at the President’s Trump Tower property</a> on his last visit to the United States, among other thanks and praise, to which the President responded positively.  Since the President personally benefits from business at his properties, foreign leaders’ stays at his properties may be a constitutionally prohibited emolument.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Coverup &ndash; Mishandling records</span> The White House&rsquo;s record of the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelenskyy phone call <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-white-house/index.html">was filed in a location meant for highly classified materials</a>, the White House confirmed, even though the call did not involve classified information, in order to restrict access to it. In his Oct. 31, 2019 testimony, Tim Morrison, a White House Advisor, said that <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/morrison_final_version.pdf">the White House stored Trump-Zelenskyy call record in the classified system because of a miscommunication</a> between White House staff about how to restrict access to it to prevent the call from becoming a political issue &mdash; confirming that the action was both unusual and with the intent to restrict access. It was also reported that a transcript of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html">a call with China</a> was placed in the same system. Several laws including the Presidential Records Act require presidential records like the call record to be preserved but may not require that the records be stored in any particular electronic system.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Coverup &ndash; Withholding Whistleblower Report</span> Although the whistleblower report was written on Aug. 12, 2019 and was deemed by a Trump-appointed nonpartisan civil servant to be credible, it was withheld from Congress by a Trump-appointed political appointee, the Director of National Intelligence, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/22/whistleblower-complaint-has-congress-trump-an-impasse-heres-what-law-says/">possibly in violation of existing law</a> that requires that credible complaints be forwarded confidentially to Congress.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Obstruction</span> The White House sent a letter to the House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry stating that it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/politics/wh-letter-to-pelosi/index.html">will not respond to the committees&rsquo; subpoenas</a> because, they say, the House is not affording the President due process rights as he would have in a criminal trial &mdash; but an impeachment is not a trial. If the House completes the inquriy and votes to impeach, which is similar to preparing a list of charges, then only at that point would a trial will be held in the Senate. Refusal to cooperate with subpoenas could likely become another impeachment charge, as it was in <a href="https://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment">the case of President Richard Nixon</a>. Failure to comply with a congressional subpoena <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45653.html">is a crime</a>.</p>

          How Impeachment &amp; Removal Works
        </h1>

        <p>Impeachment is the first step in the Constitutional process for Congress to remove the president or other government officers. Although the Constitution sets a broad two-step process for impeachment and removal, there are many steps that have evolved from previous times impeachment and removal have been used on lower government officers, such as judges. No president has ever been removed from office.</p>

        <p>Below you&rsquo;ll find a simplified timeline of how impeachment and removal works, and some links to research reports that provide more detailed information.</p>

        <h2>A Simple Timeline for Impeachment and Removal</h2>

    <h3>Impeachment in the House of Representatives</h3>
    <p><span class="header2">① Impeachment Inquiry</span> On Sept. 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will move forward with an official impeachment inquiry. This announcement alone is enough to begin official impeachment proceedings, starting with the directive that six House committees continue their investigations of the President “under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.”</p>
    <p><span class="header2">② Investigative Authority</span> In the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/politics/trump-impeachment-definition.html">cases of Presidents Nixon and Clinton</a>, a resolution was necessary to grant the House Judiciary Committee with authorities to conduct an investigation into impeachment. However, under the current House rules, the committee already has those authorities. <b style="color: rgb(175, 33, 70)">&larr; We are here.</b></p>
    <p><span class="header2">③ Committee Reports</span> After investigating, committees will report their findings to the House as a whole. In the past, the House Judiciary Committee has voted on whether to recommend impeachment and has reported an impeachment resolution with specific allegations of misconduct. Each investigating committee may report separate findings.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">④ Vote on Impeachment</span> The House would then vote on an impeachment resolution containing articles of impeachment, which are the charges of misconduct. This vote only requires a simple majority for passage. If passed, the subject of the inquiry is impeached &mdash; which means the matter is referred next to the Senate.</p>

    <h3>Trial in the Senate</h3>
    <p><span class="header2">⑤ Preparation for a Trial</span> If the House chooses to impeach, there will be a trial in the Senate to determine if the President is guilty. To start this process, the House will select “managers” to present evidence to the Senate and to subpoena witnesses, and the Senate will issue a writ of summons to the impeached official to appear.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">⑥ Trial</span> The trial is roughly analogous to a criminal court trial, with the House managers playing the role of the prosecution, the Senate as the jury, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as the judge, and the impeached official is the defendant. However, the Constitution is clear that it is not a criminal trial, since the standards for evidence and conviction are up to the Senate.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">⑦ Deliberation</span> Similar to a jury, the Senate meets in closed session to deliberate the substance of the trial.</p>
    <p><span class="header2">⑧ Vote on Conviction</span> Finally, the Senate votes on each article of impeachment separately. These votes require a ⅔rd majority to convict, which results in removal from office.  The Senate may also vote on whether the convicted official becomes disqualified from holding a government position again, for which only a simple majority is required.</p>

    <h3>Appealing a Conviction</h3>
    <p><span class="header2">⑨ Judicial Review</span> Impeachment proceedings have been challenged in federal court on a number of occasions. In the unlikely event that the president is impeached and the Senate convicts him, there may be lawsuits to appeal the conviction. However, courts have said in the past that Congress&rsquo;s power to impeach is broad and in many cases is not subject to judicial review.</p>
